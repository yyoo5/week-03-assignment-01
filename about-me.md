Hello! I'm Yong Hee Yoo
Iâ€™m a 22 year old aspiring Designer currently pursuing a MDes + MBA degree at Illinois Institute of Technology.

I strive to create a future where most problems could be solved through design- an affordable, eco-friendly, and human-centered design for everyone disregarding their age, gender, race or social background.

I am currently seeking a 2022 Summer Internship related to UI/UX field or User Research.
